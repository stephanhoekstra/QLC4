# QLC4
 QLC4 project for DMX contol

# Initial Setup (Windows)
- Clone this repo to C:\QLC4\
- Go to [QLC Downloads](https://www.qlcplus.org/download) and get the latest version installer (currently 4.14), install it on top of this repo. 
- That's it -> open Hidden-Workspace.qxw in QLC4

# Install Fixtures (Windows)
Use _Fixtures/install.bat to copy downloaded fixtures to the folder where QLC expects them

# Troubleshooting (Windows)
- Eurolite USB Dongle will only work in PRO Output: Pro Rx / Tx
- Common problem: when midi controller buttons dont work, its usually because the same button maps to multiple virtual buttons

# Ideas for PIX
- Color Slide
- Dynamic color washes

# Ideas for derby
- use it primarily as a wild extra effect with strobes
- use slow scan to set a color based mood (other fixtures should have complementary colors)

Ideas from Mezerg show
- split cleanly in to three dimensions
 - left: preset color palettes (complimentary or adjacent)
 - middle: dimmer effects which can be combined. this includes specials like strobes (think about how to visually demark them on the controller)
 - right: set pieces, which are combinations of preset colors and dimmer effects
